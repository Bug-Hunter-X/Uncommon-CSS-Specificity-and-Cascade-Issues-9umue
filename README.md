This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky CSS issue involving specificity and the cascade.  The `bug.css` file shows code that produces unexpected styling results due to style conflicts and specificity problems. The `bugSolution.css` offers a resolution using techniques such as more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (used sparingly). The `README.md` provides a detailed explanation of the problem and solution.
