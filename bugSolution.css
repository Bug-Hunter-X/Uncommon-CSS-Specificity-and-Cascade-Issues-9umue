To fix the specificity issue, we can adjust selectors in the stylesheet to be more specific, thus ensuring our intended styles are applied correctly. For example, we can increase the specificity of a selector by adding extra IDs or classes or being more precise about the target elements. In some cases, using the `!important` flag might be necessary, but it should be used carefully and sparingly as it breaks the natural CSS cascade, making styles harder to maintain. We can replace conflicting rules with ones that have higher specificity to prevent unexpected rendering.
